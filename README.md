# Creature Masters Battle

[![CI](https://github.com/srobby2000/poke/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/srobby2000/poke/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A real-time, Pokémon Masters-inspired 3v3 battle game built with React, TypeScript, and three.js. Build a team of three from a nine-Pokémon roster and climb an endless ladder of increasingly tough rival battles.

## Features

- **Team selection** — pick any 3 of 9 allies (Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Vulpix, Machop, Eevee, Abra, Geodude, Jigglypuff), each with a distinct role, passive, and moveset
- **Stage progression** — enemies grow stronger every stage; your best cleared stage is saved locally between sessions
- **Live PokeAPI stats** — base stats are fetched from [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co) (cached for 7 days) with identical bundled values as an offline fallback
- **Real-time combat** — a shared move gauge fills over time; spend it on moves while enemies act on their own cooldowns
- **Full 18-type chart** — main-series type effectiveness, same-type attack bonus, and role-based damage modifiers
- **Per-ally sync moves** — each ally charges its own sync countdown by acting; unleash big sync attacks with a team-wide damage boost
- **Unity attacks** — charge a team gauge and fire a combined attack from all living allies
- **Status conditions** — burn, poison, and paralysis (which slows your gauge and can fully block actions)
- **Stat-stage moves** — Withdraw, Growl, and X-item trainer moves raise and lower attack/defense stages
- **Rival trainer AI** — the enemy team's trainer heals weakened teammates and buffs attackers before sync moves
- **Damage variance & crits** — seeded RNG (0.85–1.0× rolls, 1/16 crit chance) keeps battles deterministic in tests but varied in play
- **Smart targeting** — auto mode picks the best matchup; manual mode honors your selected target
- **Attack projectiles & sound** — moves fly as glowing orbs that land exactly when damage applies, with synthesized WebAudio effects (mutable)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `1/2/3` moves, `Q/W/E` switch allies, `Space` sync, `T` trainer move, `U` unity, `M` target mode, `P` pause, `F` 2x speed
- **Pause and fast-forward** — freeze the battle or run it at double speed

### Architecture notes

- Game logic lives in a **pure reducer** (`battleReducer`) with no React dependencies — fully unit-testable and deterministic via a seedable RNG
- All tunable numbers (damage modifiers, cooldowns, status durations) live in the exported `BALANCE` object in `battleState.ts`
- Logic ticks at a fixed **30Hz** while visuals animate at full frame rate; the reducer preserves object identity for unchanged units so memoized components skip re-rendering
